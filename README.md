JUDGING

After the initial round of submissions, the TUN Selection Committee will evaluate all submissions using the following criteria: 

- Originality of idea, quality of argumentation, writing quality, and overall contribution to new knowledge (pushing the boundaries).

- Undergraduate and graduate student submissions will be evaluated in separate categories.

- Starting this year, a brand-new Teradata Technology Award will be given to the team with the best use of Teradata technology (Teradata Aster or Teradata Database). 
Finalists will be invited to the conference where the competition will continue with students giving a short formal presentation of their research to conference members attending the academic track. The following day, students will also present their posters/demos to all conference attendees. Conference attendees will then vote for various awards and winners will be recognized during an awards ceremony at the conference.
